# Classical Non-rigid Registration for Prostate MR Images

> **Note**: Please read the
> [DeepReg Demo Disclaimer](introduction.html#demo-disclaimer).

This is a special demo that uses the DeepReg package for classical nonrigid image
registration, which iteratively solves an optimisation problem. Gradient descent is used
to minimise the image dissimilarity function of a given pair of moving and fixed images,
often regularised by a deformation smoothness function.

## Application

Registering inter-subject prostate MR images may be useful to align different glands in
a common space for investigating the spatial distribution of cancer.

## Data

https://promise12.grand-challenge.org/

## Instructions

- Change current directory to the root directory of DeepReg project;
- Run `demo_data.py` script to download an example MR volumes with the prostate gland
  segmentation;

```bash
python demos/classical_mr_prostate_nonrigid/demo_data.py
```

- Run `demo_register.py` script. This script will register two images. The optimised
  transformation will be applied to the moving images, as well as the moving labels. The
  results, saved in a timestamped folder under the project directory, will compare the
  warped image/labels with the ground-truth image/labels.

```bash
python demos/classical_mr_prostate_nonrigid/demo_register.py
```

## Tested DeepReg Version

v0.1.6
