    the weights correspond to the floor corners,
    for example, when num_dimension = len(loc_shape) = num_bits = 3
    weights = [w1, w2, w3] (ignoring the batch dimension)
    so for corner with coords (x, y, z), x, y, z's values are 0 or 1
        weight for x = w1 if x = 0 else 1-w1
        weight for y = w2 if y = 0 else 1-w2
        weight for z = w3 if z = 0 else 1-w3
    so the weight for (x, y, z), denoted by W_xyz is
          ((1-x) * w1 + x * (1-w1))
        * ((1-y) * w2 + y * (1-w2))
        * ((1-z) * w3 + z * (1-w3))
    which equals
        the weight for (x, y) * ((1-z) * w3 + z * (1-w3))
    let W_xy = the weight for (x, y)
    W_xyz equals
          (W_xy * (1-z)) * w3
        + (W_xy * z) * (1-w3)
    So W_xy0 = W_xy * w3
       W_xy1 = W_xy * (1-w3)

    So V = sum over x,y,z (V_xyz * W_xyz)
         = sum over x,y ( V_xy0 * W_xy0 + V_xy1 * W_xy1 )
         = sum over x,y ( V_xy0 * W_xy * w3 + V_xy1 * W_xy * (1-w3) )
         = sum over x,y ( W_xy * (V_xy0 * w3 + V_xy1 * W_xy * (1-w3)) )

    so there are in total 12 degrees of freedom
    the equation can be denoted as
        new = old * T

    - new is the transformed coordinates, of shape (1, 4)
    - old is the original coordinates, of shape (1, 4)
    - T is the transformation matrix, of shape (4, 4)

    the equation can be simplified to

                                  [* * *]

    - old is the original coordinates, of shape (1, 4)
    - T is the transformation matrix, of shape (4, 3)

    Given original and transformed coordinates,
    we can calculate the transformation matrix using
        x = np.linalg.lstsq(a, b)
    such that
        a x = b
    in our case,
    - a = old
    - b = new
    - x = T

    To generate random transformation,
    we choose to add random perturbation to corner coordinates as follows:
    for corner of coordinates (x, y, z), the noise is
        -(x, y, z) .* (r1, r2, r3)
    where ri is a random number between (0, scale)
    so
        (x', y', z') = (x, y, z) .* (1-r1, 1-r2, 1-r3)
    thus, we can directly sample between 1-scale and 1 instead
