def pyramid_combination(
    values: list, weight_floor: list, weight_ceil: list
) -> tf.Tensor:
    r"""
    Calculates linear interpolation (a weighted sum) using values of
    hypercube corners in dimension n.

    For example, when num_dimension = len(loc_shape) = num_bits = 3
    values correspond to values at corners of following coordinates

    .. code-block:: python

        [[0, 0, 0], # even
         [0, 0, 1], # odd
         [0, 1, 0], # even
         [0, 1, 1], # odd
         [1, 0, 0], # even
         [1, 0, 1], # odd
         [1, 1, 0], # even
         [1, 1, 1]] # odd

    values[::2] correspond to the corners with last coordinate == 0

    .. code-block:: python

        [[0, 0, 0],
         [0, 1, 0],
         [1, 0, 0],
         [1, 1, 0]]

    values[1::2] correspond to the corners with last coordinate == 1

    .. code-block:: python

        [[0, 0, 1],
         [0, 1, 1],
         [1, 0, 1],
         [1, 1, 1]]

    The weights correspond to the floor corners.
    For example, when num_dimension = len(loc_shape) = num_bits = 3,
    weight_floor = [f1, f2, f3] (ignoring the batch dimension).
    weight_ceil = [c1, c2, c3] (ignoring the batch dimension).

    So for corner with coords (x, y, z), x, y, z's values are 0 or 1

    - weight for x = f1 if x = 0 else c1
    - weight for y = f2 if y = 0 else c2
    - weight for z = f3 if z = 0 else c3

    so the weight for (x, y, z) is

    .. code-block:: text

        W_xyz = ((1-x) * f1 + x * c1)
              * ((1-y) * f2 + y * c2)
              * ((1-z) * f3 + z * c3)

    Let

    .. code-block:: text

        W_xy = ((1-x) * f1 + x * c1)
             * ((1-y) * f2 + y * c2)

    Then

    - W_xy0 = W_xy * f3
    - W_xy1 = W_xy * c3

    Similar to W_xyz, denote V_xyz the value at (x, y, z),
    the final sum V equals

    .. code-block:: text

          sum over x,y,z (V_xyz * W_xyz)
        = sum over x,y (V_xy0 * W_xy0 + V_xy1 * W_xy1)
        = sum over x,y (V_xy0 * W_xy * f3 + V_xy1 * W_xy * c3)
        = sum over x,y (V_xy0 * W_xy) * f3 + sum over x,y (V_xy1 * W_xy) * c3

    That's why we call this pyramid combination.
    It calculates the linear interpolation gradually, starting from
    the last dimension.
    The key is that the weight of each corner is the product of the weights
    along each dimension.

    where each * represents a degree of freedom,
    so there are in total 12 degrees of freedom
    the equation can be denoted as

        new = old * T

    where

    - new is the transformed coordinates, of shape (1, 4)
    - old is the original coordinates, of shape (1, 4)
    - T is the transformation matrix, of shape (4, 4)

    the equation can be simplified to

    .. code-block:: text

                                      [* * *]

    so that

    where

    - new is the transformed coordinates, of shape (1, 3)
    - old is the original coordinates, of shape (1, 4)
    - T is the transformation matrix, of shape (4, 3)

    Given original and transformed coordinates,
    we can calculate the transformation matrix using

        x = np.linalg.lstsq(a, b)

    such that

        a x = b

    In our case,

    - a = old
    - b = new
    - x = T

    To generate random transformation,
    we choose to add random perturbation to corner coordinates as follows:
    for corner of coordinates (x, y, z), the noise is

        -(x, y, z) .* (r1, r2, r3)

    where ri is a random number between (0, scale).
    So

        (x', y', z') = (x, y, z) .* (1-r1, 1-r2, 1-r3)

    Thus, we can directly sample between 1-scale and 1 instead

    We choose to calculate the transformation based on
    four corners in a cube centered at (0, 0, 0).
