# Quick Start

## Setup

DeepReg is written in Python 3 (>=3.7). Dependent external libraries include those
provide core IO functionalities and other standard processing tools. The dependencies
for this package are managed by `pip`.

The package is primarily distributed via Github with future support via PyPI.

### Create a virtual environment

The recommended method is to install DeepReg in a dedicated virtual environment to avoid
issues with other dependencies. The conda enviroment is recommended:
[Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) /
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html):

DeepReg is primarily supported and regularly tested with Linux distros Ubuntu/Debian.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### ** Linux **

With CPU only

```bash
conda create --name deepreg python=3.7 tensorflow=2.2
conda activate deepreg # Activate the environment
```

With GPU

```bash
conda create --name deepreg python=3.7 tensorflow-gpu=2.2 # Use conda for nvidia related packages
conda activate deepreg # Activate the environment
```

#### ** MacOS **

With CPU only

```bash
conda create --name deepreg python=3.7 tensorflow=2.2
conda activate deepreg # Activate the environment
```

With GPU

:warning: Not supported or tested.

#### ** Windows **

With CPU only

:warning: DeepReg is not fully supported under Windows, however,
[Windows Subsystem Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
may be recommended for use with CPU only. Then follow the instructions with Linux.

With GPU

:warning: Not supported or tested.

### Install the package

The recommended method is to clone the repository and install it locally. All necessary
dependencies will be installed automatically.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepRegNet/DeepReg.git # clone the repository
pip install -e . # install the package
```

Optionally, you can install the
[master branch](https://github.com/DeepRegNet/DeepReg.git) of the package directly from
the repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/DeepRegNet/DeepReg.git
```

## Train

Train a registration network using unpaired and labeled example data with a predefined
configuration:

```bash
deepreg_train --gpu "" --config_path deepreg/config/unpaired_labeled_ddf.yaml --log_dir test
```

where

- `--gpu ""` indicates using CPU. `--gpu "0"` uses the GPU of index 0 and `--gpu "0,1"`
  uses two GPUs.
- `--config_path deepreg/config/unpaired_labeled_ddf.yaml` provides the configuration
  for the training. Read configuration for more details.
- `--log_dir test` specifies the output folder, the output will be saved in `logs/test`.

## Predict

The trained network can be evaluated using unseen example test dataset:

```bash
deepreg_predict --gpu "" --ckpt_path logs/test/save/weights-epoch2.ckpt --mode test
```

where

- `--gpu ""` indicates using CPU for inference.
- `--ckpt_path logs/test/save/weights-epoch2.ckpt` provides the checkpoint path of the
  trained network. As a copy of training configuration is saved under `logs/test/`
  during training, so no configuration is required as input in this case.
- `--mode test` indicates the inference on the test dataset. Other options include
  `train` or `valid`.

This is a demo using example dataset to train a registration network. Read tutorials and
documentation for more details.

## Warp

DeepReg provides a command line interface (CLI) tool to warp an image / label with a
dense displacement field (DDF):

```bash
deepreg_warp --image data/test/nifti/unit_test/moving_image.nii.gz --ddf data/test/nifti/unit_test/ddf.nii.gz --out logs/test_warp/out.nii.gz
```

where

- `--image` provides the file path of the image/label. The image/label should be saved
  in a nifti file with suffix `.nii` or `.nii.gz`. The image/label should be a 3D / 4D
  tensor, where the first three dimensions correspond to the moving image shape and the
  fourth can be a channel of features.
- `--ddf` provides the file path of the ddf. The ddf should be saved in a nifti file
  with suffix `.nii` or `.nii.gz`. The ddf should be a 4D tensor, where the first three
  dimensions correspond to the fixed image shape and the fourth dimension has 3 channels
  corresponding to x, y, z axises.
- `--out`, provides the file path for the output. It should end with `.nii` or
  `.nii.gz`.
