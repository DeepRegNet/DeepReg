Introduction to DeepReg Demos
=============================

DeepReg offers multiple built-in dataset loaders, supporting nifti and h5
file format, and a variety of training strategies often encountered
in real clinical scenarios, whether images are paired, grouped or
labelled.

A typical workflow to develop a `registration network`_ using DeepReg
includes:

- Select a dataset loader, among the `unpaired, paired and grouped`_,
  and prepare data into folders as required;
- Configure the network training in the configuration yaml file(s), as
  specified in `supported configuration details`_;
- Train and tune the registration network with the `command line tool`_
  ``deepreg_train``;
- Test or use the final registration network with the `command line tool`_
  ``deepreg_predict``.

Besides the detailed tutorials, a series of demos are provided to
showcase a wide range of applications with real-world clinical image and label data.
These applications range from ultrasound, CT and MR images,
covering many clinical specialties such as neurology, urology,
gastroenterology, oncology, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

Each DeepReg Demo provides step-by-step instructions
to explain how different scenarios can be implemented with DeepReg.
All data sets used are open-accessible.
Pre-trained models and numerical-and-graphical inference results
are also available.

.. note::

   DeepReg Demos are provided to demonstrate functionalities in DeepReg.
   Although effort has been made to ensure these demos are representative
   of real-world applications, the implementations and the results are not
   peer-reviewed or tested for clinical efficacy. Substantial further
   adaptation and development may be required for any potential clinical
   adoption.

Paired Images
=============

The following DeepReg demos provide examples of
using paired images.

- `Paired CT lung registration <paired_ct_lung.html>`__

  This demo registers paired CT lung images, with optional weak supervision.

- `Paired MR-US brain registration <paired_mrus_brain.html>`__

  This demo registers paired preoperative MR images and 3D tracked ultrasound images for
  locating brain tumours during neurosurgery, with optional weak supervision.

- `Paired MR-US prostate registration <paired_mrus_prostate.html>`__

  This demo registers paired MR-to-ultrasound prostate images, an example of
  weakly-supervised multimodal image registration.

Unpaired Images
===============

The following DeepReg demos provide examples of
using unpaired images.

- `Unpaired CT abdominal registration <unpaired_ct_abdomen.html>`__

  This demo compares three training strategies, using unsupervised, weakly-supervised and
  combined losses, to register inter-subject abdominal CT images.

- `Unpaired CT lung registration <unpaired_ct_lung.html>`__

  This demo registers unpaired CT lung images, with optional weak supervision.

- `Unpaired MR hippocampus registration <unpaired_mr_brain.html>`__

  This demo aligns hippocampus on MR images between different patients, with optional weak
  supervision.

- `Unpaired ultrasound images registration <unpaired_us_prostate_cv.html>`__

  This demo registers 3D ultrasound images with a 9-fold cross-validation. This strategy
  is applicable for any of the available dataset loaders.

Grouped Images
==============

The following DeepReg demos provide examples of using grouped images.

- `Pairwise registration for grouped prostate images <grouped_mask_prostate_longitudinal.html>`__

  This demo registers grouped masks (as input images) of prostate glands from MR images,
  an example of feature-based registration.

- `Pairwise registration for grouped cardiac MR images <grouped_mr_heart.html>`__

  This demo registers grouped CMR images, where each group has multi-sequence CMR images from a single patient.

Classical Registration
======================

The following DeepReg demos provide examples of
using classical registration methods.

- `Classical affine registration for head-and-neck CT images <classical_ct_headneck_affine.html>`__

  This demo registers head-and-neck CT images using iterative affine registration.

- `Classical nonrigid registration for prostate MR images <classical_mr_prostate_nonrigid.html>`__

  This demo registers prostate MR images using iterative nonrigid registration.
