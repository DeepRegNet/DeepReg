DeepReg
=======

.. note::

    DeepReg :superscript:`beta` will be released in Autumn 2020 - however, many
    tutorials, demos and much of the core functionality are already
    accessible.

DeepReg is a freely available, community-supported open-source toolkit
for research and education in medical image registration using deep
learning.

The current version is implemented as a `TensorFlow2`_-based framework,
and contains implementations for unsupervised- and weakly-supervised
algorithms with their combinations and variants. DeepReg has a practical
focus on growing and diverse clinical applications, as seen in the
provided examples - `DeepReg Demos`_.

`Get involved`_ and help make DeepReg better!


Features
--------

DeepReg extends and simplifies workflows for medical imaging researchers
working in TensorFlow 2, and can be easily installed and used for
efficient training and rapid deployment of deep-learning registration
algorithms.

DeepReg is designed to be used with minimal programming or scripting,
owing to its built-in command line tools.

Our development and all related work involved in the project is public,
and released under the Apache 2.0 license.
