# DeepReg

**DeepReg is a freely available, community-supported open-source toolkit for research
and education in medical image registration using deep learning.**

The current version is implemented as a [TensorFlow2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)-based
framework, and contains implementations for unsupervised- and weaky-supervised
algorithms with their combinations and variants. DeepReg has a practical focus on
growing and diverse clinical applications, as seen in the provided examples -
[DeepReg Demos](https://deepregnet.github.io/DeepReg/#/tutorial_demo). Read the
[documentation and tutorials](https://deepregnet.github.io/DeepReg/) for more details.

> _DeepReg^beta will be released in Autumn 2020 - however, many tutorials, demos and
> much of the core functionality are already accessible._

## Features

DeepReg extends and simplifies workflows for medical imaging researchers working in
TensorFlow 2, and can be easily installed and used for efficient training and rapid
deployment of deep-learning registration algorithms.

DeepReg is designed to be used with minimal programming or scripting, owing to its
built-in command line tools.

Our development and all related work involved in the project is public, and released
under the Apache 2.0 license.
