# DeepReg

**DeepReg is a freely available, community-supported open-source toolkit for research
and education in medical image registration using deep learning.**

- TensorFlow 2-based for efficient training and rapid deployment;
- Implementing major unsupervised and weakly-supervised algorithms, with their
  combinations and variants;
- Focusing on growing and diverse clinical applications, with all DeepReg Demos using
  open-accessible data;
- Simple built-in command line tools requiring minimal programming and scripting;
- Open, permissible and research-and-education-driven, under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Getting Started

- [DeepReg.Net](http://deepreg.net/)
- [Documentation, Tutorials, and Quick Start](https://deepreg.readthedocs.io/)
- [Medical Image Registration Demos using DeepReg](https://deepreg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demo/introduction.html)
- [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/DeepRegNet/DeepReg/issues/new/choose)

## Contributing

Get involved, and help make DeepReg better! We want your help - **Really**.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code.** Equally important to the
open-source process is writing or proof-reading documentation, suggesting or
implementing tests, or giving feedback about the project. You might see the errors and
assumptions that have been glossed over. If you can write any code at all, you can
contribute code to open-source. We are constantly trying out new skills, making
mistakes, and learning from those mistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy
to help others learn with us.
