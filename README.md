**DeepReg is an open-source toolkit for research in medical image registration using
deep learning.**

The current version bases on TensorFlow 2. This toolkit contains implementations for
unsupervised- and weaky-supervised algorithms with their combinations and variants, with
a practical focus on diverse clinical applications, as in provided examples.

This is still under development. However, some functionalities can be accessed already.
