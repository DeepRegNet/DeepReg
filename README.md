**DeepReg is a freely available, community-supported open-source toolkit for research
and education in medical image registration using deep learning.**

<<<<<<< HEAD The current version is implemented as a
[TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)-based framework, and contains
implementations for unsupervised- and weaky-supervised algorithms with their
combinations and variants. DeepReg has a practical focus on growing and diverse clinical
applications, as seen in the provided [examples](./docs/tutorial_demo.md). Read the
[documentation and tutorials](https://deepregnet.github.io/DeepReg/#/) for more details.

## Features

> _Right now, DeepReg is still under-development - however, many tutorials, demos and
> much of the core functionality are already accessible._ =======

- TensorFlow2-based for efficient training and rapid deployment;
- Implementing major unsupervised and weakly-supervised algorithms, with their
  combinations and variants;
- Focusing on growing and diverse clinical applications, with all DeepReg Demos using
  open-accessible data;
- Simple built-in command line tools requiring minimal programming and scripting;
- Open, permissible and research-and-education-driven, under the Apache 2.0 license.

> _DeepReg<sup>beta</sup> will be released in Autumn 2020 - however, many tutorials,
> demos and much of the core functionality are already accessible._
