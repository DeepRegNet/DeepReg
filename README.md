**DeepReg is a freely available, community-supported open-source toolkit for research in
medical image registration using deep learning.**

The current version is implemented as a
[TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)-based framework, and contains
implementations for unsupervised- and weaky-supervised algorithms with their
combinations and variants. DeepReg has a practical focus on growing and diverse clinical
applications, as seen in the provided [examples](./docs/tutorial_demo.md). Read the
[documentation and tutorials](https://deepregnet.github.io/DeepReg/#/) for more details.

## Features

_Right now, DeepReg is still under-development - however, many tutorials, demos and much
of the core functionality are already accessible._

DeepReg **extends and simplifies workflows for medical imaging researchers** working in
TensorFlow 2, and can be easily installed and used across multiple platforms for **rapid
deployment of deep-learning algorithms**.

DeepReg is designed to be used with **minimal programming or scripting**, owing to its
built-in command line tools.

Our development and all related work involved in the project is public, and **released
under the Apache 2.0 license**.

## Getting Started

Demos and examples are located in [DeepReg/docs](./docs/tutorial_demo.md).

Feel free to read DeepReg's [documentation](https://deepregnet.github.io/DeepReg/#/) as
well.
